<h1 align="center">Domain Migration Analyzer 👁️</h1> 

## 🔴Problem
Imagine the situation where your company is in the process of migrating corporate email addresses to a new domain. A portion of the user accounts has already been successfully migrated, while others remain on the old domain. The requirements are to collect all remaining email addresses and determine the number of users yet to be migrated.
## 🏁Solution
The solution to this problem involves importing a CSV file containing all company users, then filtering the list based on the domain specified by the user. This allows for a clearer understanding of which users still need to be migrated and helps in assessing the resources required for the remaining migration process.
## 📃How to use
Please insert one csv file at a time on the Files folder. After the insertion run the code and reply to the prompts showed in the screen. Check the console for the results.
